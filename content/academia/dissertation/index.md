## Introduction

> To such critics I would say – “to you I am neither Man nor Woman – I come before you as an Author only – it is the sole standard by which you have the right to judge me – the sole ground on which I accept your judgement.{{<sub "[[1]](#endnotes)">}} [**Charlotte Brontë**]

The above quotation is a fragment of a letter written by Charlotte Brontë to one of her publishers, as an imagined response to critics who would “praise [*Jane Eyre*] if written by a man”{{<sub "[[2]](#endnotes)">}} but condemn it “‘odious’ if the work of a woman.”{{<sub "[[3]](#endnotes)">}} This declaration is an act of laying claim to her right to authorship, but more specifically it is a redefinition of what it means to be “an ‘Author.” By defining it as a role that is predicated on being “neither Man nor Woman,” Brontë is shifting the notion of authorship away from its gendered roots. Specifically, by employing the term in its capitalised form, she is invoking an idea derived from a Romantic notion of an ‘Author,’ meaning a unique individual who is the sole creator and proprietor of a piece of literary work. In this Romantic tradition, the ‘Author’ is intrinsically bound up with the patriarchy and is seen as a male figure{{<sub "[[4]](#endnotes)">}}, as Andrew Bennett explains. He also posits that it was the introduction of the Copyright Act of 1710 that “allowed the author to gradually to come into legal existence,”{{<sub "[[5]](#endnotes)">}} and reflected the cultural change of the ‘Author’ as a figure with complete ownership over their own work. In this way, Brontë, as a post-Romantic author, is appropriating a distinctly androcentric literary heritage, assuming an authority over the ‘self’ that accompanies this status of ‘Author.’ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more recently, there has been critical debate about whether our understanding of the ‘Author’ as a unitary figure is entirely accurate. Post-structuralists, such as Roland Barthes, have notably reassessed and problematised the notion of the ‘Author,’ claiming that it was not a unified, singular entity – but rather a set of cultural assumptions. In his essay, “The Death of the Author” (1967), Barthes argues that when viewing a text with the enlightenment that “writing is the destruction of every voice […] that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away,”{{<sub "[[6]](#endnotes)">}} it liberates the text from the constraints of the ‘Author’. This means that the text transcends the “‘message’ of the Author-God”{{<sub "[[7]](#endnotes)">}} and becomes “a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings […] blend and clash.”{{<sub "[[8]](#endnotes)">}} In this way, we can view Barthes as a critic who advocates for the deprioritisation of the author, when exploring a text.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Barthes would presumably argue that, when examining Charlotte Brontë’s novels, we should eliminate any notion of the ‘Author’ from our analysis, in actuality, this is incredibly unproductive and enforces a set of constraints that he would desire to remove. A crucial aspect of Brontë’s novels – as is especially notable in both *Jane Eyre* (1847) and *Villette* (1853) – is the exploration of authorship. Both first-person narrators investigate what it means to author the ‘self,’ particularly in relation to their gender. Thus, both novels serve as textual playgrounds for the protagonists to develop an understanding of how they can be simultaneously a woman and obtain an authority over their selfhood. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy K. Miller argues that the deconstruction of authorship is far too premature when tackling the works of women writers. Miller proposes that since “women have not had the same historical relation of identity to origin, institution, production that men have had,”{{<sub "[[9]](#endnotes)">}} this means that “[women] have not, […] felt burdened by too much self.”{{<sub "[[10]](#endnotes)">}} She elucidates that “[because] the female subject has juridically been excluded from the polis, hence decentred, […] her relation to integrity and textuality, desire and authority, displays structurally important differences from that universal position.”{{<sub "[[11]](#endnotes)">}} This is most evident within *Jane Eyre* and *Villette*, as they possess two prime examples of female narrators who are only just discovering what it means to simultaneously be a woman and an author of their own story. Thus, to deconstruct our understanding of the ‘Author’ would be to eradicate a fundamental aspect of Brontë’s novels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recognise that these novels, as texts that both focus on the writing of ‘selfhood,’ and therefore, are (to different degrees) forms of fictional autobiographies. Linda Anderson explains that autobiography is an area of study that critics have attempted to “control […] within disciplinary boundaries,”{{<sub "[[12]](#endnotes)">}} due to its “pervasiveness and slipperiness.”{{<sub "[[13]](#endnotes)">}} Let me be clear, I do not invoke Anderson’s criticisms to ground Brontë’s novels in the tired and misplaced belief that Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe are textual replicas of Brontë herself. This problematic view can be epitomised in an 1877 review by critic and biographer, Leslie Stephen, who stated: “In no books is the author more completely incarnated. [Brontë] is the heroine of her two most powerful novels.”{{<sub "[[14]](#endnotes)">}} Rather, I align with critics who have directly refuted such claims, such as Sarah E. Maier, who argues that to reduce Brontë’s novels to a mere product of her biographical existence is to remove the agency that accompanies the “deliberate”{{<sub "[[15]](#endnotes)">}} and conscious “craft”{{<sub "[[16]](#endnotes)">}} of authorship. Specifically, I cite her to emphasise the complex relationship that the novel’s protagonists have with their own selfhood. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is this very complication that I will be exploring in this essay. In my first chapter, I will investigate how, within *Jane Eyre*, the protagonist is on a quest to obtain complete authority over her ‘self,’ as the ‘Author’ of her own autobiography. We will see how Jane's identity as a female figure cast to the margins complicates her pursuit for this androcentric status. My second chapter will be focused on *Villette* – particularly how Lucy Snowe deals with her understanding of selfhood. Although both novels deal with the issue of having authority over the ‘self,’ I will demonstrate that Lucy’s attitude towards selfhood is antithetical to Jane’s; particularly in the way that Jane has been actively (re)claiming her selfhood, whilst Lucy deliberately seeks to erase her textual ‘self.’

## Chapter One:
### Jane Eyre and the (Re)Clamation of the 'Self'

In *Jane Eyre: An Autobiography*, Jane begins to lay claim to the ownership and authority over her ‘self’ even before the formal beginning of the novel. The title clearly indicates that the central focus of the novel is a person called Jane Eyre. Therefore, before we have even begun reading the ‘actual’ novel, we have encountered the silhouette of a distinct, individual protagonist. Moreover, the subtitle implies that the author has a degree of control over her own narrative. “An Autobiography” acts as an authorising stamp, verifying that the contents of the novel are sanctioned by the author/protagonist. This was further emphasised in the first edition, as the novel was published as “Edited by Currer Bell.” Through the use of this male pseudonym, Charlotte Brontë is “seeking freedom of ungendered authorship,”{{<sub "[[17]](#endnotes)">}} as Maier puts it. Not only this, but it creates a distance between Brontë and her fictional author, framing Jane Eyre as an author in her own right. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the fact that the novel’s title is a proper name establishes *Jane Eyre* as following on from the novelistic tradition. Ian Watt explains that from the inception of novel, “novelists paid greater attention to the particular individual than had been common before.”{{<sub "[[18]](#endnotes)">}} He elaborates that the “function of proper names”{{<sub "[[19]](#endnotes)">}} as “the verbal expression of the particular identity of each individual person […] was first fully established in the novel.”{{<sub "[[20]](#endnotes)">}} Thus, *Jane Eyre* has grafted itself into the European literary convention of prioritising the individuality of the protagonist. However, Brontë’s novel deviates from this tradition as it includes “the heroine’s maiden name”{{<sub "[[21]](#endnotes)">}} in the title. Steven Earnshaw asserts that by including ‘Eyre’ in the title, it “asks the reader to appreciate the heroine […] as a single female, not as somebody who will gain significance once married.”{{<sub "[[22]](#endnotes)">}} In this way, we can see how Jane is attempting to construct a ‘self’ that is markedly individual and free from the gendered shackles of the very tradition she seeks to be a part of.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving beyond the title, and into the main body of the novel, Jane begins to directly encounter the importance of naming with regards to having authority over one’s ‘self.’ In the first few chapters, Jane has very little knowledge about her origins. As an orphan, living marginalised and neglected in her aunt’s household, all Jane knows is that she has “poor, low relations”{{<sub "[[23]](#endnotes)">}} who share her name – Eyre. At this point in the novel, the name signifies a lower-class identity. Jane reveals that this definition has been created and disseminated by Mrs Reed, Jane’s aunt. Through this very definition of Eyre, Jane’s selfhood and status is, in turn, defined. Following on from their mother’s example, Mrs Reed’s children have adopted this definition, which is most manifest in John Reed’s insistence of Jane’s inherent inferiority. He declares to Jane: 

> You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mamma says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mamma’s expense.{{<sub "[[24]](#endnotes)">}}

Following this execration, John Reed assaults Jane, hurling the book at her head, which results in a bloody head injury. This cruel act of violence is a direct result of the definition of Eyre, as promulgated by Aunt Reed. Therefore, we can see that the Reeds have significant authority over Jane’s selfhood, not her. Their proprietorship over the meaning of her name means that her ‘self’ is completely in the clutches of an external force.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what makes this scene so significant, is that this is the moment that Jane actively begins to reclaim ownership over her ‘self.’ After being struck by John Reed, Jane retorts: “Wicked and cruel boy! […] You are like a murderer – you are like a slave-driver – you are like the Roman emperors!”{{<sub "[[25]](#endnotes)">}} Jane’s triptych of insults (“murderer,” “slave-driver,” and “the Roman emperors”) are three examples of figures who wield authority over others and reduce the agency of those people. The “murderer” has ultimate control over whether the victim lives or dies, the “slave-driver” has complete authority over a slave’s body, and the “Roman emperor” has absolute control over an entire empire. This last comparison is particularly significant as it invokes the fall of the Roman Empire, serving to foreshadow John Reed’s demise later in the novel{{<sub "[[26]](#endnotes)">}}. In this way, we get a taste of Jane’s power as an author, to be able to exact vengeance on the wicked. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, this declaration highlights the moment that Jane applies what she has read (“Goldsmith’s History of Rome”) to a practical reclamation of her ’self’ from the cruel clutches of her oppressor. Symbolically, this act of her recasting John Reed as a “slave-driver,” in turn, recasts Jane into the role of the “rebel slave”{{<sub "[[27]](#endnotes)">}} (as she dubs herself in the following chapter). By applying this label to her ‘self,’ Jane appears to be aligning with the marginalised. However, what is important to note, is that as much as Jane appears to be developing a sense of justice, with regards to self-ownership and oppressors, this education is founded on her readings of a book published in the heights of the ‘First Empire.’ This was when Britain was in the apogee of its dealings with the slave trade{{<sub "[[28]](#endnotes)">}}. Oliver Goldsmith’s ‘History of Rome’ (1769) was forged at a time when colonial aspirations of domination, ownership, and absolute authority were rife. In this way, we can see why Jane equally desires complete control, as she has constructed her selfhood on a set off ideologies that prioritise authority over the ‘self’ at all costs. Later on, we will see precisely what cost this comes at, when examining Jane’s portrayal of Bertha Mason.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before we explore this further, let us look at the ways in which Jane’s quest to (re)claim ownership and authority over a unified ‘self’ is complicated. In Chapter II, following the denouement of the fight with John Reed, Jane states: “I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say.”{{<sub "[[29]](#endnotes)">}} Although being “beside” or “out” of oneself might be meant in a figurative sense (as in that she is “out of one's wits, out of one's senses”{{<sub "[[30]](#endnotes)">}} (OED)), this statement is much more fascinating if we examine it more literally. To truly be ‘beside’ oneself would suggest a physical distancing between two aspects of her ‘self.’ In this way, there is a disruption to Jane’s process of becoming a distinct individual.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might argue that this is occurring as a result of a childish, intense emotional response. However, there is another instance of this fractured selfhood later on in the novel, in Thornfield Hall, during Jane’s adulthood. When she is not working as a governess, she explains that in her spare time she finds pleasure in pacing “along the corridor of the third story”{{<sub "[[31]](#endnotes)">}} and to “allow [her] mind’s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it”{{<sub "[[32]](#endnotes)">}} and “to open [her] inward ear to a tale that never ended – a tale that [her] imagination created.”{{<sub "[[33]](#endnotes)">}} The term “mind’s eye” is one that we are already quite familiar with, but the term “inward ear” is one that is far less familiar. Both are describing an aspect of Jane’s interiority, particularly the processing of her “imagination”. The “eye” is evocative of the mental pictures that she is witnessing and the “inward ear” of the tales that accompany them. By labelling her imaginative process with such biological terms of “eye” and “ear,” Jane distorts this vivid description into something cold and remote. Something odd and unfamiliar. This is an act of disowning her own imagination and mental processes. To reexamine those lines, she even specifies that she must “allow” or “open” herself to her own imagination, as if she is the third party between her ‘self’ and her “imagination”. Once again, we are witnessing Jane’s understanding over her ‘self’ as unitary begin to be rendered unstable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not the only occurrence of Jane’s disowning of the self. In light of this this novel’s status as a *bildungsroman*, a tale of personal progress and change, one would expect these discrepancies of selfhood to be ironed out as the novel progresses. Yet at the end of Chapter XXVI, following the failed wedding between Rochester and Jane Eyre, the latter expresses to the reader: “I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master’s – which he had created.”{{<sub "[[34]](#endnotes)">}} Here Jane claims that her “love” was not indeed her own, but in actuality belongs to her master (Rochester). This is a paradoxical statement, as this feeling is indeed hers, as she expressed through the use of the possessive adjective “my,” yet Jane appears to be renouncing any ownership over it. Jane has dissociated from her own emotion to such an extent that she claims that she “looked” at it. Therefore, we see yet another example Jane disown a part of herself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that this is a text whose central focus is the assertion of the ‘Author’s’ individuality, the reappearance of a fragmented selfhood indicates that Jane’s self-fashioning is constructed upon unstable ground. It is important to remember that Jane’s notion of authorship is predicated on a Romantic model. As Andrew Bennett explains, “the Romantic author is always a fiction. The Romantic conception of authorship involves an ideal, an impossible ideal, of autonomy.”{{<sub "[[35]](#endnotes)">}} Although Jane does not realise it, “the Romantic author is always a fiction.” {{<sub "[[36]](#endnotes)">}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Jane’s incomplete understanding of the true workings of this Romantic model, that she has emulated, extends to an ignorance of how they directly affect her. As a woman, in the British Empire, she inherently has less authority over her ‘self’. Therefore, she will never be able to fully (re)claim ownership of her very being, particularly in a legal sense. From birth she lacks authority over her ‘self’ because she begins the novel as an orphan. According to Hugh Cunningham, orphans were held in the same regard as “Gypsies, criminals, and colonized subjects, none of whom were thought to be properly rooted within English society.”{{<sub "[[37]](#endnotes)">}} Yet, since this is a *bildungsroman*, surely Jane’s level of authority over her ‘self’ would have been elevated by the end of the novel? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final chapter, Jane reveals that she has married Rochester and is writing her autobiography “ten years”{{<sub "[[38]](#endnotes)">}} after their marriage. She declares to the reader: “I am my husband’s life as fully as he is mine.”{{<sub "[[39]](#endnotes)">}} Jane uses the adverb “as,” which the OED explains is especially used in “expressing a comparison of equivalence.”{{<sub "[[40]](#endnotes)">}} This indicates that Jane believes that she is existing on equal terms with her husband in their marriage. It is true, as Jane emphasises, that “Mr Rochester continued blind the first two years of [their] union”{{<sub "[[41]](#endnotes)">}} and she served as “his vision”{{<sub "[[42]](#endnotes)">}} and “his right hand.”{{<sub "[[43]](#endnotes)">}} In that sense, their positions were levelled, and her increased social status has seemingly become more secure. It appears that Jane can now begin to (re)claim her selfhood through her increased social status.  However, this does not outweigh the significant legal realities of their marriage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that she is legally married to Edward Rochester, where does this leave her legal entitlements? According to critic Phillip Mallett, before the ‘Married Woman’s Property Act in 1882,’ “on marriage, the control of and income from a woman’s real property” and “personal property” was “passed absolutely into [the husband’s] control”{{<sub "[[44]](#endnotes)">}}. What this means for Jane Eyre, as a woman who had recently come into possession of an inheritance of “twenty thousand pounds”{{<sub "[[45]](#endnotes)">}} and all of her uncle’s property in Madeira{{<sub "[[46]](#endnotes)">}}, is that Rochester now has legal possession of these assets. Of course, Jane did give away fifteen thousand of those pounds to her cousins Diana, Mary, and St John Rivers{{<sub "[[47]](#endnotes)">}}; however, this does not diminish the fact that Jane no longer has complete ownership of her property. Not only does Rochester have absolute control of her property, but he is also legally entitled to her body. Mallett explains that at this point in history, “a woman’s body was […] held to belong to her husband.”{{<sub "[[48]](#endnotes)">}} Additionally, until the’ Infants Custody Act of 1886’, “the father remained during his lifetime the sole legal guardian” of the child{{<sub "[[49]](#endnotes)">}}. As Rochester’s wife, Jane effectively holds the same legal status as she did as an orphaned child at the beginning of the novel. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to obtain full authority over her ‘self,’ Jane must depart from her associations with the identity of the “rebel slave.” As discussed earlier in the chapter, Jane applies her understanding of oppression and rebellion to defend herself against the Reeds. In Chapter IV, Mrs Reed accuses Jane of having “a tendency to deceit”{{<sub "[[50]](#endnotes)">}} to Mr Brocklehurst, colouring Jane’s identity with a distinctly unpleasant tinge. Yet again, we witness somebody, other than Jane, have authority over her selfhood. Jane explains that Mrs Reed’s utterance of “deceit” was so potent that she “saw [herself] transformed under Mr Brocklehurst’s eye.”{{<sub "[[51]](#endnotes)">}} This metaphorical morphing indicates that Mrs Reed has ownership of Jane very being, as she has the power to control how other’s view Jane, which significantly contributes to the construction of selfhood. However, now that Jane has an education in the significance of authority and domination, she advances in conquest to retrieve her ‘self.’ She does so by appropriating Mrs Reed’s language, declaring: “You are deceitful!”{{<sub "[[52]](#endnotes)">}} This act of (re)claiming the ‘self,’ has so much power that Jane is “filled with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph,”{{<sub "[[53]](#endnotes)">}} as if “an invisible bond had burst.”{{<sub "[[54]](#endnotes)">}} In this way, Jane demonstrates “an implicit critique of British domination and an identification with the oppressed,”{{<sub "[[55]](#endnotes)">}} as Susan Meyer puts it. Yet, if Jane were to fully maintain this alliance with the oppressed, then she would never be able to fully lay claim to her ‘self,’ as the marginalised have less authority and autonomy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially notable with regards to Jane’s relationship with Bertha. In Jane’s conquest for absolute control over the ‘self,’ she, as author, mimics the censoring and imprisonment of her colonist forebears on a textual level. In Chapter XXVI, she encounters Rochester’s legal wife, Mrs Rochester, or rather Bertha Mason, locked up in the attic of Thornfield Hall by her husband. In this way, Rochester has her physically restrained and controlled, by hiding her away in a room that can only be accessed with a “master-key.”{{<sub "[[56]](#endnotes)">}} This adjective, “master,” is significant as it is evocative of Rochester as a ‘slave master.’ This is not a misplaced connection, as Meyer explains, Rochester “would undoubtedly have had slaves to wait upon him, and his Jamaican fortune would of course have been the product of slave labour.”{{<sub "[[57]](#endnotes)">}} Rochester’s acts of oppression and control of the racial ‘Other’ is self-evident. However, Jane Eyre is equally complicit in these colonial practices, just more covertly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the novel, Jane refuses to utter Bertha’s name in any form. She exclusively refers to Bertha through disparaging titles, such as “the maniac”{{<sub "[[58]](#endnotes)">}} or “the lunatic.”{{<sub "[[59]](#endnotes)">}} As previously established, a name is “the essence of a person”{{<sub "[[60]](#endnotes)">}} and is what establishes them as a human. Therefore, the act of refusing to name Bertha is an active denial of Bertha’s humanity and selfhood. Jane insists that Bertha is subhuman, as is evident in this humiliating depiction:

> What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.{{<sub "[[61]](#endnotes)">}}

Coupled with such a dehumanising description, Jane’s feeble attempts to display pity for Bertha in the following chapter (“she cannot help being mad”{{<sub "[[62]](#endnotes)">}}) come across as being acutely superficial. Jane knows all too well that to control someone’s name is to control their identity. It is quite clear that Jane does not desire to acknowledge or permit Bertha’s selfhood. Since she herself has experienced marginalisation and loss of control over own identity, one would expect her to be sympathetic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must not we must not forget that Bertha is a “Creole”{{<sub "[[63]](#endnotes)">}} from “Spanish Town, Jamaica.”{{<sub "[[64]](#endnotes)">}} As Jenny Sharpe explains, “Due to the long history of racial mixing in Jamaica, the scandal the Creole presented to the British was the possibility of a white person who was not racially pure.”{{<sub "[[65]](#endnotes)">}} And “racial purity is identified with an English national culture.”{{<sub "[[66]](#endnotes)">}} As we have previously established, Jane has constructed her ‘self’ on a foundation of colonialism, which is deeply entrenched with racial hierarchies; this is equally applicable to her construction of Bertha. Gayatri Spivak also asserts that “Bertha Mason is a figure produced by the axiomatics of imperialism”{{<sub "[[67]](#endnotes)">}} and that her “function in *Jane Eyre* is to render indeterminate the boundary between human and animal and thereby to weaken her entitlement under the spirit if not the letter of the Law.”{{<sub "[[68]](#endnotes)">}} Therefore, to acknowledge Bertha as a human being, as an equal, would be to destabilise these hierarchies. If Jane were to admit to the existence of a fundamental flaw within this set of ideologies upon which her sense of ‘self’ is built, she would be admitting that her entire foundation is defective and lacks authority. In this way, Bertha is a threat to Jane’s colonial conquest of self-ownership. Ultimately, this is why Jane, as the author, kills Bertha – to ensure the legitimacy and safety of her emerging selfhood. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been previously established, as much as Jane is a figure of feminism, she is still distinctly a figure of the British Empire. Having laid claim to a ‘self’ constructed on the foundations of colonial axiomatics, she is still subject to their ways. It is for this reason that any desire for equality between men and women, must remain only as a wish, or a thought. Although Jane expresses a fervent longing for “liberty”{{<sub "[[69]](#endnotes)">}} and “for a power of vision which might overpass that limit,”{{<sub "[[70]](#endnotes)">}} she can never fully act upon that yearning. We see this all the way back at the beginning of the novel, in Chapter V, where Jane cries that it is “for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer.”{{<sub "[[71]](#endnotes)">}} Accompanying this desire for freedom from oppression, she acknowledges that such a wish will lead to others blaming her. She states, “Who blame me? Many, no doubt,”{{<sub "[[72]](#endnotes)">}} which highlights her acute awareness of the judgements of others. This is what leads her to think better of her call for liberty, as she ultimately prays for a “new servitude”{{<sub "[[73]](#endnotes)">}} instead. To fully have a liberated ‘self,’ under the pressures of imperialism, Jane must distance herself from others who are oppressed (hence, her treatment of Bertha). As a subject of the empire, even though she may invoke the language of revolution, in the end, Jane must conform.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly, as an author who is publishing her autobiography for the public, she is “bound” to construct a ‘self’ that will elicit “some degree of interest” from the reader{{<sub "[[74]](#endnotes)">}}, as Jane explains in Chapter X. In this way, we can see that for Jane Eyre to be a unified ‘self’ who has successfully (re)claimed ownership and authority over her ‘self’ is a complete impossibility because of who she is (a woman), when she lives (early 19th century), and where she lives (British Empire). Just as Charlotte Brontë asserted her right to be judged “as an Author only” and as “neither Man nor Woman,” we can see that as much as that might have been her desire, that was not the result. Neither author – Brontë nor the fictional Jane Eyre – are able to have full authority or ownership over their ‘selves’.

## Chapter Two: 
### Lucy Snowe and the Erasure of the 'Self'

If, in *Jane Eyre*, we have seen a protagonist strive, yet ultimately fail, in the quest to (re)claim control over her ‘self,’ then within *Villette*, we witness a protagonist with quite a different objective. Whilst Jane Eyre has been actively pursuing a concrete, unitary ‘self,’ in *Villette* we see Lucy Snowe eschew the ‘self’ and shift the contours of a diaphanous personhood in and out of visibility. Despite the fact that ‘selfhood’ and ‘personhood’ are frequently used interchangeably, it is crucial to distinguish the nuances between the two. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the ‘self’ as “The ego (often identified with the soul or mind as distinct from the body); […] a true or enduring personal identity.”{{<sub "[[75]](#endnotes)">}} This definition appears to align with the Romantic notion of the ‘self,’ as something unitary and singular. Although the OED defines a ‘person’ (“An individual human being; a man, woman, or child”{{<sub "[[76]](#endnotes)">}} similarly to that of ‘self’, there is still a distinct difference that we must not neglect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Person’ is partially derived from the classical Latin *persōna* – or “mask used by a player, character in a play, dramatic role, the part played by a person in life”{{<sub "[[77]](#endnotes)">}} (OED). In this way, to use the word ‘person’ is not to invoke a singular individual, but rather the notion of a multifaceted human being who possesses several ‘masks’ and plays different ‘parts.’ This is in stark contrast to the ‘self,’ which is fundamentally entwined with the notion of oneness and singularity. In this way, we can view the multifarious Lucy Snowe to be investigating her personhood, as opposed to her selfhood{{<sub "[[78]](#endnotes)">}}.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as the issue of naming was significant within *Jane Eyre*, with regards to the construction of identity, it is equally so in *Villette*. Perhaps most obviously, the title of this novel, *Villette*, does not correspond to the name of the protagonist and narrator, unlike *Jane Eyre*, but rather to a town that Lucy Snowe visits. Sally Shuttleworth states that “the very title of her book […] gives precedence not to selfhood but to place.”{{<sub "[[79]](#endnotes)">}} In this instance, it is not the significance of naming, but instead the very act of not naming. Shuttleworth explains this stylistic decision as “[Lucy’s] commitment to evasion and displacement.”{{<sub "[[80]](#endnotes)">}} Whilst Shuttleworth uses this example to emphasise Lucy’s complicated psychological state, I am more interested in how this is a departure from the very tradition that was fundamental to the construction of *Jane Eyre*. For the protagonist of this bildungsroman to have their name as the novel’s title, is to give priority to that name. And, as discussed in the previous chapter, the proper name “is inseparable from ourselves”{{<sub "[[81]](#endnotes)">}} and “functions to individualise that person.”{{<sub "[[82]](#endnotes)">}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in *Villette*, Lucy Snowe has a fundamentally different understanding of her selfhood, which is evident in her treatment of her own name. Within Chapter II (Paulina) she utters the phrase: “I, Lucy Snowe, plead guiltless,"{{<sub "[[83]](#endnotes)">}} and once again reemploys this structure in Chapter III (The Playmates) – “I, Lucy Snowe, was calm.”{{<sub "[[84]](#endnotes)">}} Through the delineating boundary of the comma, we get the sense that these are two separate facets of her being. For Anna Gibson, this detachment is an act of “Rendering this ‘I’ as a third-person ‘Lucy Snowe,’”{{<sub "[[85]](#endnotes)">}} producing “an external manifestation of the ‘calm’ and "docile" type Lucy appears to others in a world full of gazes.”{{<sub "[[86]](#endnotes)">}} If we understand this to be true, then whenever Lucy invokes her proper name, she is identifying an “external” reality that is largely shaped by the perceptions of others and is distinct from the internal reality of ‘I.’ Whilst these facts initially appear contradictory, I will discuss this later on to explain how it operates as a functioning paradox.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the author of her own identity, Lucy emphasises this distinction consistently throughout the novel. Whether it be in Chapter XXVII (The Hotel Crécy), where she pines the alternative life of Lucy Snowe that never came to pass: “Had Lucy been intrinsically the same, but possessing the additional advantages of wealth and station, would [Graham’s] manner to her, [his] value for her have been quite what they were?”{{<sub "[[87]](#endnotes)">}} A Lucy Snowe who was fundamentally altered by her relation to others and her position in society. Or whether it be in the final chapter (Finis), where she announces to the reader that Monsieur Paul “loved Lucy and had much to say to her,”{{<sub "[[88]](#endnotes)">}} that facet of her personhood as perceived by others. There is always a palpable dissociation between her external projection and her internal reality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, this detachment extends beyond the role of proper names, proving to be equally the case concerning her corporeality in general. This is evident at the beginning of Chapter IV (Miss Marchmont), where she leaves the home of her god-family “to return to the bosom of [her] kindred.”{{<sub "[[89]](#endnotes)">}} Yet, she does not reach the safety of home; instead, she encounters a “wreck”{{<sub "[[90]](#endnotes)">}} and experiences the “rush and saltness of briny waves in [her] throat, and their icy pressure on [her] lungs.”{{<sub "[[91]](#endnotes)">}} In spite of this documentation of a physical reality, she declares that she will “permit the reader to picture”{{<sub "[[92]](#endnotes)">}} her in the opposite conditions. “Picture me then idle, basking, plump, and happy, stretched on a cushioned deck, warmed with constant sunshine,”{{<sub "[[93]](#endnotes)">}} Lucy asserts. Such an insistence that the reader must “picture” her, emphasises Lucy’s role as the author of her own identity. This metafictional moment asks the reader to construct, within their imagination, the external manifestation of her personhood. However, it is not indeed the reader who has control over this aspect of her ‘person,’ but rather Lucy is guiding the reader to craft a specific version of her, to suit her purposes. Yet, we still must ask ourselves, why would she authorise two contradicting plot lines? Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz claims that this is a “defensive strategy,”{{<sub "[[94]](#endnotes)">}} that “by changing events she can exercise control in a way that she could not by merely recounting them.”{{<sub "[[95]](#endnotes)">}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lucy Snowe is not always able to exercise this level of control over how others perceive her. In fact, she exhibits a deep sense of anxiety and discomfort whenever she feels like she is being observed. One notable instance is in Chapter XIV (The Fête), when Lucy Snowe’s “sanctuary”{{<sub "[[96]](#endnotes)">}} is disrupted at the entrance of M. Paul, whose “two eyes first vaguely struck upon me, then hungrily dived into me.”{{<sub "[[97]](#endnotes)">}} Such a transformation of being seen, into a gruesome, cannibalistic metaphor implies that Lucy experiences this moment of visibility as intensely disturbing and threatening. To become visible to another person is to be metaphorically devoured. Why does she have such an extreme emotional reaction to being seen? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we answer that question, let us examine an earlier moment in the novel, when Lucy first enters the *Pensionnat de Demoiselles*, Madame Beck summons M. Paul to “read [Lucy Snowe’s] countenance”{{<sub "[[98]](#endnotes)">}} through his “skill in physiognomy.”{{<sub "[[99]](#endnotes)">}} Lucy’s reaction here is albeit less extreme than the cannibalistic metaphor; however, she still expresses the creeping sensation that M. Paul “meant to see through me, and that a veil would be no veil for him.”{{<sub "[[100]](#endnotes)">}} This notion that despite her attempts for privacy, by clothing herself in a metaphorical “veil,” she will still be stripped naked and vulnerable for the prying eyes of others. In this way, the perception of others, which has partially shaped her identity, is now transformed into something that endangers Lucy’s personhood, as she now risks the uncovering of hidden facets of her identity, including all ‘sinful’ desires.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuttleworth asserts that Lucy Snowe possesses a “phrenological world view,”{{<sub "[[101]](#endnotes)">}} ‘phrenology’ being the pseudo-scientific study of “the contours of the outer surface of the skull”{{<sub "[[102]](#endnotes)">}} as a way to assess “the strength of the corresponding mental ‘faculty’ in the operation of the mind.”{{<sub "[[103]](#endnotes)">}} This means that one can “read [another’s] inner self through the interpretation of outer signs.”{{<sub "[[104]](#endnotes)">}} More than that, Shuttleworth reminds us, that this moment with M. Paul is “a phrenological diagnosis of latent potential”{{<sub "[[105]](#endnotes)">}} which ultimately concludes that “if Lucy is to succeed, it must be by a process of *self*-control, subduing her 'evil' propensities, and encouraging the good.”{{<sub "[[106]](#endnotes)">}} In this way, we can see that for Lucy, to have her “outer signs” decoded then it will potentially reveal her moral state. On top of that, Shuttleworth explains how at the time that *Villette* was written, “The medical and popular press were full of alarmist reports of an exponential rise in cases of insanity,”{{<sub "[[107]](#endnotes)">}} and that “insanity” was a very gendered phenomenon, going “hand in hand with that of femininity.”{{<sub "[[108]](#endnotes)">}} This was also a time when “the insane were no longer to be sharply distinguished from the sane, but, correlatively, no one could now rest assured of their own sanity.”{{<sub "[[109]](#endnotes)">}} Therefore, for Lucy, as someone who believes in phrenology, or at least comprehends its workings, the stakes of being observed are extremely high. This is in stark contrast to *Jane Eyre*, where there was safety in the apparent distinctions between ‘sane’ and ‘insane,’ where Jane had projected her own fears of insanity onto the character of Bertha.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a shift in the cultural perception of ‘insanity’ is particularly pertinent for Lucy Snowe, as throughout the novel, she is consistently presented as existing in a “highly nervous state,”{{<sub "[[110]](#endnotes)">}} as Dr John diagnoses her. Such a diagnosis is ultimately disproven, as the nun that Lucy has spotted lurking around the *Pensionnat* (which Dr John believed to be a figment of her “imagination”{{<sub "[[111]](#endnotes)">}}) was proven to be in fact Colonel de Hamal disguised in a nun’s habit{{<sub "[[112]](#endnotes)">}}. In this way, we can once again see how the perceptions of others create an incomplete picture of Lucy’s personhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, her psychological troubles manifest most obviously in Chapter XV (The Long Vacation), she is left alone in the pensionnat, whilst all the students and the other teachers depart for the holiday. Her only companion is a “crétin”{{<sub "[[113]](#endnotes)">}} who has “a vague bent to mischief, an aimless malevolence.”{{<sub "[[114]](#endnotes)">}} But even then, so too does the “crétin” leave. Lucy is left in utter “solitude,”{{<sub "[[115]](#endnotes)">}} and she experiences an intense longing for “companionship.”{{<sub "[[116]](#endnotes)">}} The yearning is so profound that she compares her “want of companionship”{{<sub "[[117]](#endnotes)">}} to “the cravings of a most deadly famine."{{<sub "[[118]](#endnotes)">}} Ultimately, the “suffering”{{<sub "[[119]](#endnotes)">}} that plagues her “racked and oppressed mind,”{{<sub "[[120]](#endnotes)">}} results in her collapsing and feinting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy reflects upon this moment of mental torment later on in the novel, in Chapter XXIV (M. De Bassompiere):

> The world can understand well enough the process of perishing for want of food: perhaps few persons can enter into or follow out that of going mad from solitary confinement. They see the long-buried prisoner disinterred, a maniac, or an idiot! – how his senses left him – how his nerves, first inflamed, underwent nameless agony, and then sunk to palsy – is a subject too intricate for examination, too abstract for popular comprehension.{{<sub "[[121]](#endnotes)">}}

This evocative sketch is certainly reminiscent of Lucy Snowe’s “nervous collapse”{{<sub "[[122]](#endnotes)">}} in Chapter XV. Lucy’s “senses left” her as she went to the confessional in the Roman Catholic church (which is highly unusual for such a staunch anti-Catholic) and her “nerves, first inflamed, underwent nameless agony” as she “lay in a strange fever of the nerves and blood.”{{<sub "[[123]](#endnotes)">}} Although this sketch quite clearly mirrors Lucy Snowe state, there is a certain degree of distance between her and the “long-buried prisoner” of this image. In this illustration, she depicts a man enduring this mental duress. Whilst this gender shift could serve to legitimise these maladies of the mind, perhaps more significantly, by invoking this memory in the position of a man, she dissociates herself even further from her “nervous collapse.” In this way, she erases herself from the events of Chapter XV, replacing herself with a new male figure. A figure who in no way could resemble herself, anatomically. This act of textual self-effacement is done whilst Lucy Snowe is in the role of the author. This is not the Lucy Snowe who experienced the terrors of Chapter XV, but rather the author who is rewriting the autobiographical details of her life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, we can see how Lucy consistently erases the ‘self’ as she partakes in the very thing that strikes absolute fear into her: surveillance. As Penny Boumelha explains, “while Lucy is sometimes the victim of surveillance […], she is almost as often their perpetrator.”{{<sub "[[124]](#endnotes)">}} Lucy is indiscriminate when it comes to choosing who she observes. Whether it be those closest to her, such as Paulina, who she dubs “a mere doll; her neck, delicate as wax, her head silky curls.”{{<sub "[[125]](#endnotes)">}} Or those who she feels a strong aversion to, as witnessed in Malevola whose “malign, unfriendly eyes”{{<sub "[[126]](#endnotes)">}} and “skeleton hands”{{<sub "[[127]](#endnotes)">}} Lucy describes in striking detail. Even those who are not animate characters in the novel are not free from the unwavering gaze of Lucy Snowe. This is particularly notable within Chapter XIX (The Cleopatra), where she describes the painting of Cleopatra in scathing detail, shining a spotlight on “that wealth of muscle, that affluence of flesh.”{{<sub "[[128]](#endnotes)">}} Lucy declares to the reader that “[Cleopatra] ought likewise to have worn decent garments; a gown covering her properly.”{{<sub "[[129]](#endnotes)">}} With such elaborate descriptions of the majority of the cast of *Villette*, we scarcely have any knowledge of what Lucy Snowe herself looks like. As much as this act of surveillance can be seen as Lucy sketching a detailed image of the world around her, more significantly, this serves to displace the reader’s focus from her ‘self,’ and on to others. Not only does this shift of attention to “the details of physical setting and to the complexities of social life”{{<sub "[[130]](#endnotes)">}} ground the novel in realism, but this is also part of Lucy’s covert process of self-effacement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subtle displacement is barely noticeable for the majority of the novel, as Lucy Snowe is skilful in her mission of self-erasure. However, in Chapter XX (The Concert), there is a moment where it becomes glaringly obvious:

> I just now see that group, as it flashed upon me for one moment. […] a third person in a pink dress and black lace mantle. I noted them all – the third person as well as the other two – and for the fraction of a moment, believed them all strangers […] Thus, for the first, and perhaps only time in my life, I enjoyed the ‘giftie’ of seeing myself as others see me. No need to dwell on the result, it brought a jar of discord, a pang of regret; it was not flattering {{<sub "[[131]](#endnotes)">}}

Here, Lucy does not initially realise that she is looking into “a great mirror”{{<sub "[[132]](#endnotes)">}} and seeing her reflection. Even as she recounts this event, of seeing her external manifestation alienated from her, she does not go into detail. We only receive a slight description about her dress. She refuses to “dwell on the result,” as it was not a flattering experience of seeing her ‘self’ as others see her. Of course, we could take this explanation at face value, believing that it is simply because Lucy feels embarrassed about the whole event. Yet, upon reflection, this is a moment where it would make the most sense to describe in detail her external manifestation, as she encounters an uncanny version of her ‘self.’ However, Lucy Snowe denies the reader such a pleasure. As the author who is reconstructing this moment, Lucy is able to control how much the reader sees. Thus, she subsumes herself into the shadows. As Rabinowitz explains: “Lucy Snowe puts herself in a position of power by remaining in the dark.”{{<sub "[[133]](#endnotes)">}} Rabinowitz is far from the only critic to put this theory forth. Shuttleworth equally advocates that in “trying to render herself illegible, Lucy attempts to assume control over the processes of her own self-definition.”{{<sub "[[134]](#endnotes)">}} In this way, we can see how Lucy Snowe erases her ‘self,’ in order to create herself – or rather, her personhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Charlotte Brontë herself expressed similar sentiments. In a letter to her publisher, Williams, she declares “What author would be without the advantage of being able to walk invisible?”{{<sub "[[135]](#endnotes)">}} This statement was made in reference to her use of a pseudonym as an author, yet this statement could be just as true for Lucy Snowe. This notion of ‘invisibility’ as an “advantage” appears to be counter intuitive for women, as discussed in the previous chapter, women have historically been censored and not given a voice. But “to walk invisible” is not necessarily completely removing ones’ own existence, but rather to be able to control when one is seen, and by whom. Therefore, we can see invisibility as something that empowers, rather than enfetters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore this in more detail, let us return to the final two clauses of the first Brontë quotation that we examined: “it is the sole standard by which you have the right to judge me – the sole ground on which I accept your judgement.”{{<sub "[[136]](#endnotes)">}} It is significant that Brontë talks of “judgement” here. It is a question of condemnation and of censorship. What it means to be “invisible” as an “author,” for Brontë at least, is to be able to control the way in which she is viewed and to be able to produce her own ‘judgement’ about it. It is not a total eclipse, but rather a gauze or a veil through which the reader may perceive her. In this way, if we apply this to *Villette*, we can see that Lucy Snowe’s erasure of the ‘self’ is not as drastic an action as it initially appears. She is attempting to avoid the kind of condemnation that Graham exacts on the actress of Vashti, when “he judged her as a woman, not an artist.”{{<sub "[[137]](#endnotes)">}} To this end, Graham assesses Vashti’s value based on her gender, rather than her creative capabilities, which is precisely what Lucy seeks to elude. It is not that Lucy has been blighted off the face of the earth, nor has she vanished without a trace, but rather, she is evading just this kind of “branding judgement.”{{<sub "[[138]](#endnotes)">}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final sentence of the novel reads: “Madame Beck prospered all the days of her life; so did Pere Silas; Madame Walravens fulfilled her ninetieth year before she died. Farewell.”{{<sub "[[139]](#endnotes)">}} Such an ending, that focuses on the “villains”{{<sub "[[140]](#endnotes)">}} of the novel (as Mark Celeste puts it), rather than the protagonist, is the final act of self-effacement from Lucy Snowe the author. Although it seems that any sense of a concrete ‘self’ may have disappeared, her personhood still lingers within the shadows as a spectre. When I cite the term ‘spectre,’ I am specifically invoking the Derridean notion of the ‘spectre.’ Jacques Derrida defines the ‘spectre’ as “some ‘thing’ that remains difficult to name: neither soul nor body, and both one and the other.”{{<sub "[[141]](#endnotes)">}} It is something fundamentally in-between, something that one cannot quite define. The spectre is something that continues to exist beyond the natural end of things. In this way, when the novel ends with the spectral whisper, “Farewell,” this marks the departure of the ‘self’ and the residual presence of personhood.

## Conclusion

We have now witnessed how a fundamental aspect of Charlotte Brontë’s *Jane Eyre* and *Villette*, has been how the protagonists have contended with issues relating to authorship and selfhood. Jane Eyre has signified the nascent female author within Victorian literature of the nineteenth-century. Brontë’s creation of a fictional author, that is greatly concerned with liberty and freedom from oppression. She has become a figure of feminism, as an example of a woman who fervently pursues the right to autonomy. However, as Meyer stresses, the novel “focuses attention […] on the situation of oppressed whites in Britain”{{<sub "[[142]](#endnotes)">}} and “its ‘revolution’ improves only the lot of the middle class.”{{<sub "[[143]](#endnotes)">}} In this way, we can see how, despite Jane’s revolutionary assertions for the female ‘self,’ her conquest for control of her ‘self’ has rendered her complicit in colonialism.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucy Snowe’s involvement with colonialism is far less evident than with Jane Eyre, Lucy is still equally a figure of imperialism. Even Lucy’s very attempt to erase the ‘self’ is, in itself, an act of privilege. Historically, those who have been racially marginalised have had reduced visibility as well as a lack of bodily autonomy, at the hands of colonial oppressors. Therefore, to be able to decide to what extent she exposes her selfhood, Lucy, as a white woman in Western society, has the privilege to be able to decide whether or not her body or skin should define her identity. Moreover, when Brontë asserts – “I come before you as an Author only” – this notion of ‘Author,’ whilst degendered by Brontë, is still predicated upon whiteness. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to acknowledge these grim truths; not to diminish the power imbalances between men and women in the mid-Victorian era, but to shine a spotlight on the issues that reside within the notion of the ‘Author.’ On top of Brontë’s definition of an ‘Author’ as “neither Man nor Woman,” she also states in another letter her publisher: “The first duty of an Author is – I conceive – a faithful allegiance to Truth.”{{<sub "[[144]](#endnotes)">}} Thus, when examining Brontë’s novels, we are called to not shy away from the tarnished realities of “Truth,” but to critically confront and unveil them.
