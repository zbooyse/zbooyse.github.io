# Man Vs. Nature: Romantic Perspectives on Humans and Nature in both William Blake's "Spring" and John Clare's "Crows in Spring"

{{<sub "This essay was written during my study of the Romanticism 1780-1840 module at UEA.">}}

&nbsp;*On thy stupendous summit, rock sublime! […] I would recline, while Fancy should go forth* (Charlotte Smith, "Beachy Head," l. 1-4) 

Whilst William Blake’s collection, *Songs of Innocence and of Experience* (1789), certainly utilises nature, it is subordinate to his focus upon human emotions. Within this essay, the term ‘nature’ will chiefly be defined as that of “plants, animals, and […] the products of the earth itself.”{{<sub "[[1]](#references)">}}  Particularly within Blake’s poem, “Spring,” we witness him use nature to better concentrate upon humanity. Although Blake has a limited preoccupation with nature, for other Romantic poets nature is the cornerstone of their work. This is evident within John Clare’s work, especially his poem “Crows in Spring” which establishes nature as the predominant feature, and humans to be the lesser subject. Whilst the pair’s poems express antithetical views upon nature, they both encompass the theme of spring, or more specifically the moment of spring’s re-emergence. 

&nbsp;Within William Blake’s “Spring,” this advent of nature merely serves as a backdrop for human emotions. This is evident from the first line: “Sound the Flute!”{{<sub "[[2]](#references)">}}  The capitalisation of “Flute,”  an improper noun that would ordinarily be written in lower case, is a poetic decision that draws focus upon the musical instrument. Thus, we are impelled to consider what the significance of Blake’s choice of instrument is. Upon consideration, one understands that this manmade instrument is almost certainly a nod to humankind. Unlike the Aeolian lyre that features in Percy B. Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind,”{{<sub "[[3]](#references)">}}  the flute can only be played by the human body, as it requires both the dexterity of the fingers to press the keys as well as the human breath to produce its mellifluous melody. What is more, Blake’s firm etching of the exclamation mark at the end of the line transforms this sweet piping into something far more exuberant. 

&nbsp;In contrast, this spirited, humanly generated exclamation is followed by the lines: “Birds delight / Day and Night.”{{<sub "[[4]](#references)">}}  Although critic Robert F. Gleckner argues that these lines express an “identical response to the flute,"{{<sub "[[5]](#references)">}} the levels of energy and animation exhibited by the natural world is simply not comparable to that of humankind. Not only is there a solemn full stop, rather than an ebullient exclamation point, but “delight”  does not explicitly express that the birds are indeed singing. Rather this is the implementation of prosopopoeia, or personification, and is the projection of the speaker’s own emotions onto them. This is demonstrative of what Blake calls “the Eye of the Man of Imagination,”{{<sub "[[6]](#references)">}}  who prevents the birds from being birds and nature from simply being nature. Rather, in Blake’s Romanticism, nature is subjugated to the rule of human “Imagination”  which takes precedence above all else.

&nbsp;Alternatively, Clare’s poem acts antithetically to Blake’s, in the respect that humans are most certainly not the focus – nature is. Even before the poem truly starts, this focus on nature is evident from the title: “*Crows* in Spring” [Emphasis added]. The inaugurating word is one of nature. This focal point is maintained in the first quatrain, where Clare depicts a dynamic scene of the crows as they “tumble up and down”{{<sub "[[7]](#references)">}}  and preen themselves in the old trees{{<sub "[[8]](#references)">}}. In comparison, the only time that anything closely resembling humanity is mentioned in this verse is in the line: “And in the old trees around the town.”{{<sub "[[9]](#references)">}}  Even though humans are being mentioned, the use of the solitary nondescript noun (“town”) produces an image so vague that one can only envisage an amorphous blob of people and buildings. Furthermore, this cursory mention of humanity is solely to locate the crows and provide a more specific and detailed view of nature. By using humans as a backdrop for nature, Clare subverts the pervasive hierarchy of the Great Chain of Being (a concept which emphasises the superiority of human beings over “animal and plant life”{{<sub "[[10]](#references)">}}).  

&nbsp;Moreover, Clare reinforces the significance of nature in his poem as the crows exhibit more agency. This is notable in the final line of the first quatrain: “Brushes winter from its wing.”{{<sub "[[11]](#references)">}}  Whilst this metaphor may at first appear to solely refer to the literal dusting off of snow from their feathers, it is actually far more powerful. Figuratively, that line evokes the sense that the crows are banishing an entire season. By combining that fact with the nonchalance of the verb “Brush,” Clare bestows an agency to nature that is unparalleled to man. This agency is brought up once again later on in the poem, when the speaker explains that the crows “strut from land to land.”{{<sub "[[12]](#references)">}} The verb “strut” evokes an image of these animals walking with great grandeur and self-importance. There is the sense that these crows own this land, that the natural world rules itself. In this way, Clare contradicts the Bible, particularly Genesis where God declared that man had “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:28, KJV). Through this contradiction, Clare makes a bold statement in defence of nature, considering that he was living in a time of Christian hegemony. Thus, we can see how the rebellious spirit of his poem chimes with the revolutionary spirit that fuelled Romanticism.

&nbsp;Returning to Blake’s “Spring”, the speaker displays a completely different attitude towards nature: one of entitlement. Not only does Blake utilise nature as a backdrop for man, but he takes that one step further in his final stanza. The denouement is addressed to a “Little Lamb.”{{<sub "[[13]](#references)">}} Lambs have been long association with the Bible, as Jesus’ nickname was the ‘Lamb of God,’ in order to characterise his gentleness and his martyrdom. This is the ultimate appropriation of nature. More than simply personifying nature, it steps into outright exploitation as the lamb is reduced to be the carrier of human meaning. What is more, this connotation of sacrifice would still be potent within late-eighteenth-century Britain, as this notion of ritualistic animal slaughter/sacrifice would still be resolutely present in the cultural consciousness of this Christian society. Thus, even when animals and nature are seemingly in focus, in reality human beings are still at the centre of our attention. 

&nbsp;Blake continues his prioritisation of the human subject as the speaker goes on to declare:

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Little Lamb*
&nbsp;&nbsp;*Here I am*
&nbsp;&nbsp;*Come and lick*
&nbsp;&nbsp;*My white neck*.{{<sub "[[14]](#references)">}}

The punchy monosyllabic statement, “Here I am,” is powerfully charged with a sense of expectation as the speaker announces themself. When combined with the imperative, “Come,” Blake establishes the human speaker as the dominant presence in the relationship between man and nature. This sense of a human obligating nature to do something is augmented as the speaker announces their next instruction. The lamb is required to “Let me pull / Your soft wool.”{{<sub "[[15]](#references)">}} Whilst the first imperative “Come”  suggests that nature must fulfil a task, the second imperative, “Let,”  is more about permission and subjugation. The act of the speaker tugging on the lamb’s “wool,” as opposed to stroking, or touching it, implicates a level of force. This image is manifested in the etching that is printed alongside Blake’s song. The text is grounded with a central image at the base of the etching: an infant seated amongst sheep, with their hands tightly grasped onto the neck of the lamb. One cannot go as far to claim that this is a violent act, as Blake does not want to commit/authorise violence on nature. But rather it is more a lack of care for the feelings of nature as human desire is prioritised. 

&nbsp;This notion of humans having rule over nature once again leads our mind back to Genesis 1:28. Unlike with Clare, Blake stands firm with the biblical teaching that nature is there to be subdued by man. All natural things can be understood to serve humanity; their purpose is relegated to their relations to humans. This emphasis upon human feeling is revisited in the last line where we return to the last line of the refrain, “Merrily Merrily we welcome in the Year.”{{<sub "[[16]](#references)">}}  The refrain is structurally in stark contrast to the other eight lines of the same stanza. Maintaining a mere three syllables, the preceding lines cower in the shadow of the refrain which boasts a hefty twelve syllables. Above all, the distinct focal point of the refrain is the repetition of the adverb “Merrily.”  In this way, Blake highlights human emotion as the focus of the poem. This is augmented by the fact that in this final refrain, Blake changes “to welcome”{{<sub "[[17]](#references)">}}  into “we welcome.”  This shift into using the first-person collective pronoun, “we,” is a declaration of the speaker on behalf of the entire human race. In this way, Blake prioritises the state of the human soul and bequeaths it a precedence above all else in this poem, especially above nature.

&nbsp;On the other hand, John Clare expresses the opposite within “Crows in Spring,” where he depicts a nature unrestricted by human terms. This is especially evident through the central image of the “crow.” Within literary history, crows have “generally been regarded as unlucky, and as omens of death,”{{<sub "[[18]](#references)">}} as is especially notable in folk ballads, such as “The Three Ravens.” Critic John Lucas explains that “Clare drew on this culture and tradition [of the ballads] all his life”{{<sub "[[19]](#references)">}}  and that “he loved the ballads he learnt from his father.”{{<sub "[[20]](#references)">}}  With this knowledge, Clare subsequently “banishes” those deeply entrenched cultural connotations of crows from his poem by pairing them with spring, the season associated with birth and new life.

&nbsp;What is more, he continues to remove these human associations even further within the fourth stanza. Clare expresses that the crows “seem to try all ways to sing / And almost to speak in glee.”{{<sub "[[21]](#references)">}}  This mention of the distinctly human emotion of “glee” could be viewed as a form of prosopopoeia. However, the personification is not fully exercised, as Clare modulates it with the use of the adjective “seem” and the adverb “almost.” They produce a tentative tone from the speaker. In this way, we can see that Clare’s hesitation to personify nature is an expression of his consciousness of the human desire to bound nature in human terms. By actively preventing this, he necessitates the reader to become equally conscious of their own tendency to project their humanness onto nature. 

&nbsp;Moreover, in the following quatrain, Clare exhibits how nature’s methods are just as powerful, if not more, than the human ones thrust upon it. The speaker explains that the crows “Proclaim the winter by”{{<sub "[[22]](#references)">}} through the message of their “new nest nearly made.”{{<sub "[[23]](#references)">}} The verb, “Proclaim,”  implies that the birds maintain a level of dignity and gravitas, which accords with the fact that it is an Anglo-Norman word (c1393){{<sub "[[24]](#references)">}} because Anglo-Norman words typically have more formal, ceremonious connotations. By producing this authority for the crows, Clare demonstrates that nature generates its own authority and laws that humans are incapable of ever fully comprehending. The crows are conveying the same message that the speaker thought they might “speak in glee,” but instead the crows communicate through the artistry of nest making. This natural invention sparks feelings of “wonder”{{<sub "[[25]](#references)">}}  in the “ploughman”{{<sub "[[26]](#references)">}}  and the “schoolboy.”{{<sub "[[27]](#references)">}}  By using the term “wonder”, Clare is directly referencing the Romantic notion of the sublime. As Edmund Burke explained in *A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful*, “Astonishment […] is the effect of the sublime in its highest degree.”{{<sub "[[28]](#references)">}} However, Burke also asserts that the sublime “always dwells on great objects,”{{<sub "[[29]](#references)">}} whereas the beautiful is “comparatively small.”{{<sub "[[30]](#references)">}} Whilst crows are indeed a “comparatively small” and domestic animal, Clare still presents them as evoking feelings of the sublime in those who witness a crow in its natural habitat. In this way, Clare critiques Burke’s notion of the sublime, redefining the term to encompass all of nature, not only the facets that are great in magnitude. In addition, a crucial part of the sublime is what Burke calls ‘Judicious Obscurity.’ In order to achieve this obscurity, the imprint of man (through things such as personification) must be absent. Therefore, John Clare’s Romantic view is that nature is of primary importance, whereas man ought to be both secondary and left to ponder on the wonderous sublime of nature.

&nbsp;Overall, the preoccupation with nature is evident in both William Blake’s “Spring” and John Clare’s “Crows in Spring;” however, the degree to which they prioritise nature is most certainly different. For Blake, humans should be the focus of his songs, and nature should be a decorative background, both literally and metaphorically. Humans and the human experience are always his chief concern, which should not be a surprise when one considers the full title of this collection: *Songs of Innocence and of Experience; Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul* (1795). Blake’s form of Romanticism never claimed to be focusing upon nature. He was open about that from the very beginning, and we must not be mistaken to view this as a clandestine move. Blake was a "Dissenter"{{<sub "[[31]](#references)">}} of organised religion and viewed the material "world [as] an alien environment, a realm ruled by the Beast and the Whore."{{<sub "[[32]](#references)">}} Therefore, it is understandable that his artistic focus should lie in the "states of the human soul," and not nature.

&nbsp;Conversely, for Clare nature ought to be the supreme focus, whilst humans are merely marginal beings that flesh out the landscape with which he is so familiar. Nature, and all it encompasses, is a marvel in and of itself that humans cannot ever fully contain. In this way, Clare’s poem acts as a rebellion against the oppressive force of humanity that seeks to control and bound up nature. Clare spent the majority of his life living in the rurality of Northamptonshire and was a labourer who was intimately acquainted with nature. Thus, the looming figure of “The Reform Act of 1832” casts an imposing shadow over Clare’s work, which is why his poetry takes on “a note of urgency”{{<sub "[[33]](#references)">}} and “protest.”{{<sub "[[34]](#references)">}} Therefore, we can see how both William Blake and John Clare expressed different Romantic preoccupations, demonstrating the variability of Romanticism.
