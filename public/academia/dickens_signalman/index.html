<sub>This essay was written during my study of the Ghosts, Haunting and Spectrality module at UEA.</sub>
<p> <em>Here is – or rather there is, over there, an unnameable or almost unnameable thing: something, between something and someone, anyone or anything</em><sub><a href="#references">[1]</a></sub><br>
(Jacques Derrida, <em>Specters of Marx</em>, 5.)</p>
<p>The above quotation is a fragment of Jacques Derrida’s definition of the ‘spectre’ – that of something in-between and indistinct, an ever-shifting figure. This Derridean notion of the ‘spectre’ haunts a text written 127 years prior: Charles Dickens’ “The Signalman” (1866). Dickens’ short story is permeated by a perpetual uncertainty, which conjures up the presence of the supernatural ‘spectre,’ who is impelled to haunt the text. By examining this text through a Derridean lens, we can begin to unravel the hauntological paradoxes of this ghost story.</p>
<p> Incertitude is invoked from the very beginning of “The Signalman,” as the first sentence is a spectral yell: “Halloa! Below there!”<sub><a href="#references">[2]</a></sub> As Dickens’ does not assign an owner to this direct speech, very little is known of the identity of the yeller (other than that the speaker is trying to catch somebody’s attention). In the search for more context, one naturally proceeds to the following sentence, only to be met with more ambiguity. The cry is attributed to no more than “a voice.”<sub><a href="#references">[3]</a></sub>  The indefinite article, “a,” engenders a disembodied “voice” that is not bound to a corporeal being. In this way, Dickens introduces the very first in a string of hauntological paradoxes: a human voice that has not emerged from a human. An occurrence that should not be possible yet has indeed happened. This is an indication of the potential ‘spectre’ that is yet to come.</p>
<p> However, as the opening paragraph progresses, this conflict is seemingly resolved. This quotation has apparently originated from the first-person narrator of this tale, who declares that the listener “could not have doubted from what quarter the voice came.”<sub><a href="#references">[4]</a></sub> The narrator’s initial certainty is grounded in the firm objectivity of the conditional negative of “could not,” thus, eliminating the existence of any other possibilities. Nevertheless, things are not as certain as the narrator would like to believe, as the listener is in fact unable to locate the origin of the voice. Not until the narrator repeats the cry once more, does the listener look up and “[see] my figure high above him.”<sub><a href="#references">[5]</a></sub> Although the confusion as to the source of the “voice” seems to be momentarily disentangled, later on in the story, its origins are further complicated.</p>
<p> After the narrator interrogates the listener about his identity, the latter asks his interrogator: “‘What <em>made</em> you cry, ‘Halloa! Below there!’ tonight?’”<sub><a href="#references">[6]</a></sub> [Emphasis added.] The verb “made” is the past tense of the transitive ‘make,’ which is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) as “to bring into existence by construction.” In this way, the very presence of this transitive verb renders the narrator the object of the sentence and implicates the presence of a subject who is unknown, invisible, and unspoken about. What problematises our certainty even further is the fact that this unnamed subject appears to be interfering with human affairs. The choice to phrase the question as “what made you,” as opposed to ‘why did you,’ suggests that the narrator was compelled to “cry,” that he was stripped of his free-will by the subject.</p>
<p> We are beginning to form a mental sketch of an “unnameable,”<sub><a href="#references">[7]</a></sub>  invisible, and unknown subject, a sketch that very much resembles the Derridean ‘spectre.’ Whilst its presence is yet to be explicitly articulated, the notion of the ‘spectre’ is further hinted at. This is evident when the listener asks the narrator if he felt that the words “were conveyed to you in any supernatural way?”<sub><a href="#references">[8]</a></sub> In response, the narrator states quite categorically: “No.”<sub><a href="#references">[9]</a></sub> This monosyllabic answer curtly attempts to eliminate any potential questions or doubts from either the reader or the listener. When first examining this brief exchange, it appears that the narrator is indubitably denying any “supernatural” presence in the events of the story thus far.</p>
<p> However, upon re-examining this interaction, the true sense of the narrator’s response is far from a surface-level certainty. The listener’s full question reads: “‘<em>You</em> had <em>no feeling</em> that they were conveyed to you in any supernatural way?’”<sub><a href="#references">[10]</a></sub> [Emphasis added.] The structure of this question distorts the formal layout of a question. Rather than beginning with an interrogative (i.e., ‘Did you have any feeling…’), Dickens modifies this statement by adding a question mark to the end. Whilst this may be a perversion of the traditional structure of a question, it is not unusual for a declarative to be used as a question colloquially. Nonetheless, this question rests in an uneasy, grammatical grey space, where meaning is unstable.</p>
<p> This is equally true for its counterpart answer of “‘No.’” There is a level of uncertainty as to the true sense of this negative. Is it answering the question literally, as in ‘No, I <em>have</em> had that feeling’? Or is it answering the question in its more colloquial sense, as in ‘No, I <em>did not</em> have that feeling’? As readers, we cannot definitively state whether it is one or the other. Meaning and reality have been thrown into disorder. Once more we are stuck in a place of uncertainty, where we are faced with another hauntological paradox.</p>
<p> At this point in the narrative, we are no closer to confirming whether there really is the presence of the supernatural in this short story or not. All we have acquired are hints, whispers, and shadows of a potential ‘spectre’ that lingers in the periphery of “The Signalman.” As much as this possible ‘spectre’ has been haunting the two characters thus far, and casts the shadow of an anthropomorphic figure, there is something equally spectral and liminal in the very fabric of the landscape.</p>
<p> The events of “The Signalman” take place near the bounds of the railway tracks, on the fringes of “a black tunnel.”<sub><a href="#references">[11]</a></sub> By situating the short story at a stretch of railway that is in between destinations, neither an origin nor a terminus, Charles Dickens stations the very terrain of his tale in a state of limbo. It is significant that the setting not only serves as a liminal space but more specifically as ‘limbo’ (which the OED defines as a “region supposed to exist on the border of Hell as the abode of the just who died”). This pervasive sense that the landscape is not simply a natural conjoining of boundaries, but as a supernatural expanse between life and death, is evident in the narrator’s first impressions of the setting. He describes the landscape as having a “deadly smell”<sub><a href="#references">[12]</a></sub> and that he felt “as if he had left the natural world.”<sub><a href="#references">[13]</a></sub> Entering into this space, we are no longer somewhere that belongs to the living, but something other.</p>
<p> Moreover, the setting as a manifestation of limbo, extends to more specific features. In particular, the narrator consistently shifts our focus to “the red light near the tunnel’s mouth.”<sub><a href="#references">[14]</a></sub> The textual act of giving the tunnel a “mouth,” is an act of personification, which is <em>prosopopoeia</em> in the original Greek. Etymologically, this rhetorical device breaks down into <em>prosopon</em> (meaning face/person) and <em>poeia</em> (meaning to make). In the literal sense, <em>prosopopoeia</em> is the making of a face, which is, textually, exactly what is occurring. Dickens has rhetorically crafted the landscape a face with a “mouth” and an eye (through the “red light”).</p>
<p> This image of a human figure watching over limbo is an echo of Dickens’ textual predecessors. More specifically, this is evocative of Charon – a supernatural being who appears in Virgil’s <em>The Aeneid</em> (29-19 BC) and in Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> (1308-1321 AD). His duty, as a psychopomp, is to act as a “guide of souls to the place of the dead” (OED). In both Classical texts, he is described as having glowing red eyes (“his eyes are fixed and fiery”<sub><a href="#references">[15]</a></sub> in <em>The Aeneid</em> and he has “eyes of glowing coal”<sub><a href="#references">[16]</a></sub> in the *Inferno&amp;). This is not to say that Charles Dickens was purposefully or consciously inserting this intertextual reference. However, there is a strong sense of a textual haunting in “The Signalman” of a supernatural figure from texts written centuries prior.</p>
<p> As we draw towards the close of the short story, the potential ‘spectre’ shifts ever so slightly more into focus. On the final pages, when the narrator returns to the railway track for the final time, he has an unexpected encounter. Newly constructed below the red light is “a little low hut”<sub><a href="#references">[17]</a></sub> that “looked no bigger than a bed,”<sub><a href="#references">[18]</a></sub> which houses the body of the eponymous signalman, or as we have known him: the listener. The image of the “bed” echoes the notion of death being an everlasting sleep and the dead being laid to rest. However, the narrator never explains the fate of the signalman’s corpse. We can speculate as to whether the signalman was buried and given the proper funeral rites. Considering this story was written in the Victorian era, a time when mourning and remembrance of the dead were societally significant<sub><a href="#references">[19]</a></sub>, it is likely that the signalman was laid to rest. Even so, this must only remain as speculation, as there is neither explicit nor implicit clarification of the fate of the signalman’s body.</p>
<p> With that in mind, if we return to the realm of Greek mythology, it is significant that <em>The Aeneid</em> states that Charon “may not bring [souls] past the grisly banks/ […] until their bones find rest.”<sub><a href="#references">[20]</a></sub> In this way, the signalman is forever trapped in limbo because the mystery of his burial will never be resolved. As to the mystery of the ‘spectre,’ we are reminded of the signalman’s eerie words earlier in the text: “But surely this is a cruel haunting of me.”<sub><a href="#references">[21]</a></sub> With the knowledge of his death, we see that the signalman has taken on the form of the Derridean ‘spectre,’ destined to haunt these pages for eternity.</p>
