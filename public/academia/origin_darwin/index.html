                        <sub>This essay was written during my study of the Victorian Writing module at UEA.</sub>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading &lsquo;The Origin [of Species]&rsquo; is an act which involves you in a narrative experience. The experience may seem to diverse readers to be tragic […] or comic […] but it is always subjective and literary <strong>(Gillian Beer, &lsquo;Darwin&rsquo;s Plots,&rsquo; 3.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two months after the publication of Charles Darwin’s <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859), the Daily News responded with a critical review that concluded with the statement: “Hypotheses of any use in natural science must be but the general expression produced by the induction of all known facts, not hasty, imperfect, useless generalisations, however imposing to the imagination.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[1]</a></sub>  Whilst the Daily News censured The Origin’s propensity to captivate “the imagination”  of the reader, critic Gillian Beer asserts that the text’s success is largely dependent upon the literariness of its “narrative.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[2]</a></sub></p>
<p>       Through this view, one can examine how Darwin exploits this literary narrative as a way to creatively transform the minds of Britain and promote this very Victorian notion of progress. As <em>The Origin</em> acted as a radical reimagining of “the old static, creationist hierarchy”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[3]</a></sub>  that so saturated Victorian Britain, Darwin relied upon eliciting a singular emotion to persuade his readers: empathy. The techniques that are particularly effective in eliciting that crucial emotion are narrative voice and cultural references.</p>
<p>       <em>The Origin of Species</em>, as most literary texts do, establishes its narratorial voice in the very first pages of the text. Here we witness Darwin establish who he is and what his relation is to us, the reader. The introduction begins with the phrase: “When on board H.M.S Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck […].”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[4]</a></sub>  Through the use of the first-person pronoun “I” , we observe that this narrative hosts a first-person narrator, a distinctive self. This marker of a first-person narrator is not an isolated example; within the rest of this introductory paragraph, Darwin uses this pronoun a further seven times as well as two other first-person pronouns (“me”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[5]</a></sub> and “my”<sub><a href="references">[6]</a></sub> ). In spite of those pronouns’ diminutive size, especially in comparison to words like “Beagle”  or “naturalist,”  their cumulative footprint across the paragraph as a whole is immense.</p>
<p>       This liberal peppering of “I,” “me,” and “my” lays the foundation for a text that is reliant on a personal narrator. This is important to note since <em>The Origin</em> is not a work of fiction, but indeed a narrative founded on fact. Darwin himself is acutely aware of his personal presence in his writing and apologises for it in the very same paragraph (“I hope I may be excused for entering on these personal details”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[7]</a></sub> ). It is this personal “tone”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[8]</a></sub>  that Beer describes as “charming, and almost pathetic.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[9]</a></sub>  It is this very humbleness that particularly characterises <em>The Origin’s</em> narrative voice.</p>
<p>       Despite the first-person narrator being a constant presence within the narrative, it is not an autocratic force. Rather, Darwin’s use of the first-person is reluctantly implemented as a measure to ensure the efficacy of his argument. This is notable further on in the introduction when the narrator confides: “I trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[10]</a></sub>  The title, “the reader,”  serves as a replacement for the second-person pronoun ‘you’. Although many would utilise direct address as a technique of persuasion, Darwin’s deliberate avoidance of this is far more influential. If he were to have employed a direct address, then there would be a clear separation between the identities of him vs. us. However, by stripping us of our sense of self and reducing us to our actions, Darwin offers us the opportunity to claim a new identity, to insert ourselves into the position of the narratorial ‘I’.</p>
<p>       Through the very act of reading those first-person statements, our mind transforms those thoughts into our own, supplanting our inner monologue for Darwin’s. As Beer reminds us, “in the mid-nineteenth century, scientists still shared a common language with other educated readers and […] they shared a literary […] discourse which was readily available to readers without a scientific training.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[11]</a></sub>  Therefore, we can see how Darwin exemplifies an accessible Victorian narrative that allows the “layman”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[12]</a></sub> to view an alternative subjective perspective they otherwise would not have been able to access.</p>
<p>       Furthermore, this view is corroborated by Vera Nünning who asserts that “the first mode of inducing readers to feel empathy includes narrative strategies which prompt readers to take the characters’ perspective, for instance by presenting their thoughts […] by means of techniques like […] interior monologue”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[13]</a></sub> . Although the term ‘empathy’ had yet to be coined at the time of publication<sub><a href="#endnotes">[14]</a></sub>,  this employment of interior monologue to induce empathy is certainly present in <em>The Origin</em>. Nünning explains that during “the eighteenth century, tender feelings and pity […] were held to be very important.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[15]</a></sub>  In this way, one witnesses that Darwin is advancing beyond the bygone days when sympathy was of great significance, and into an era that exercises the benefits of empathy and acknowledges the importance of the reader’s role in a text.</p>
<p>       Moreover, this sense of the reader’s presence in the text is advanced even further as <em>The Origin</em> progresses. By the first chapter of <em>The Origin</em>, the narrator begins to favour the use of the pronoun “we,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[16]</a></sub>  and its derivations “us”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[17]</a></sub>  and “our”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[18]</a></sub> . In the very first paragraph of “Variation under Domestication”, those first-person plural pronouns are employed eight times, whereas the first-person singular (“I”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[19]</a></sub>) is only found twice. By uniting the narrator and the reader under an assumed collective pronoun, Darwin evokes a powerful marriage of minds. In this way, the reader is more likely to feel included within the narrative, than if he were to have used the separate ‘me and you’ or ‘mine and yours’.  It would have not only been rhetorically weaker but would have also divorced the narrator and reader into separate identities with independent thoughts and views. As Nünning explains: “Readers’ emotions and feelings of empathy with the characters are closely connected to the degree of immersion.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[20]</a></sub>  Thus, we witness Darwin reducing the reader’s distance to the narrative in order to achieve a thorough immersion.</p>
<p>       What is more, this collective identity of the narrator and the reader is very much distinct from another identity that is frequently present in the novel. Within the chapter, “Struggle for Existence,” Darwin uses the phrase: “We have seen that man […].”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[21]</a></sub>  Through the use of these two terms (“we”  and “man” ), one recognises that Darwin has established two distinct identities: the unified presence of narrator &amp; reader and something far more general. The noun “man” is likely used as a reference to Genesis: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion […] over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[22]</a></sub>  In this biblical sense, “man” is a representation of this “independent creation”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[23]</a></sub>  which Darwin rejected so categorically in <em>The Origin</em>. Before Darwin even explicitly rejects these archaic creationist notions, he begins to implicitly divorce himself, and us, through this lexical marriage of minds.</p>
<p>       Furthermore, Darwin extends the engagement of the reader’s empathy one step further when he begins to capture what is known as “biographical emotions,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[24]</a></sub>  which Nünning characterises as the process of “readers’ reliving of former […] emotions.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[25]</a></sub>  He utilises what is familiar to the reader in order to explain the unfamiliar. This is recognisable through his use of the adjective “monstrous.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[26]</a></sub> Whilst Darwin implements it throughout the narrative, more specifically, he explains within “Variation under Domestication” that monstrosity is the “differing from each other, and from other species of the same genus.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[27]</a></sub>  This application of “monstrous” here is relatively neutral, particularly in comparison to a novel that would have still been imprinted in the cultural consciousness: <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818) by Mary Shelley. When Shelley attributed something as ‘monstrous’ or akin to a ‘monster’, it was always powerfully charged with negative associations. In Chapter IV of Shelley’s novel, Victor Frankenstein births the Creature and describes “the miserable monster”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[28]</a></sub>  as a “demoniacal corpse”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[29]</a></sub>  and “ugly.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[30]</a></sub> This representation of a monster as an inherently diabolical and base thing is in stark contrast to Darwin’s portrayal of it – merely something innocuously “differing from each other”. In this way, his dismantling of these connotations of wickedness enables empathy to still be at play when approaching the concept of the monstrous.</p>
<p>       However, not only is this notion of difference and otherness neutralised but in fact celebrated. Throughout <em>The Origin</em>, Darwin consistently refers to “beautiful adaptations.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[31]</a></sub>  This celebration of evolution and mutability is strikingly different to <em>Frankenstein</em> which praises the “the blue lakes and snow-clad mountains”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[32]</a></sub>  with their “immutable laws.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[33]</a></sub>  Thus, Darwin appropriates the language of the Romantics, something the reader would be very familiar with, and subverts it. Although Darwin’s act of referencing cultural history is actually an act of glancing back at the past, it is only momentary. More importantly, it is a part of the process of the evolution of language. In this way, he is fixedly focused on the future and solely uses the past as a way to ensure that the readers empathise more easily with his argument.</p>
<p>       Additionally, this process of capturing what the reader perceives as familiar in order to explain the unfamiliar is also evident in the chapter “Struggle for Existence.” Here, Darwin explains “how plants and animals […] are bound together by a web of complex relations.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[34]</a></sub>  Darwin explains “that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of heartsease”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[35]</a></sub>  and “red clover.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[36]</a></sub>  What is more, those flower populations are dictated by the “number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[37]</a></sub>  and in turn, those mice populations are dictated by “the number of cats.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[38]</a></sub>  This elaborate tapestry of nature weaved by the narrator is one that is distinctly familiar: distinctly British. In this way, Darwin constructs an image that any one of his readers might be able to recognise when strolling through the outskirts of a village or small town. Just as Darwin transfigured the negative perceptions of monstrosity to elicit the empathy of the reader, likewise, he has suffused his text with elements of the familiar to further the emergence of this emotion.</p>
<p>       Moreover, this image is not only rendered spatially familiar, but also culturally familiar. Darwin’s use of “humble-bee,” rather than its more common synonym ‘bumblebee,’ is likely a reference to William Shakespeare’s <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. In Act 3 Scene 1 of Dream, the bewitched Titania orders her fairies to fetch some fruit and honey for Bottom (“Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries […] / The hony bagges steale from the humble Bees”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[39]</a></sub>). The significance of this play in relation to <em>The Origin</em> is not so much the specific action of this scene but its position in the play as a whole. This moment occurs during the rising action of <em>Dream</em>, in the midst of the characters making choices and decisions that affect one another, yet largely unwittingly. This sense of unconscious interconnectedness is paralleled in <em>The Origin</em>, where the animals, plants, and insects are completely oblivious to the fact that they are assembled in a nexus of “complex relation.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[40]</a></sub>  Considering that Shakespeare greatly influenced Darwin’s “imaginative intellectual development”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[41]</a></sub>  as well as being “acclaimed as the foremost poet in the English language and the world’s greatest dramatist in any language,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[42]</a></sub>  it is unsurprising that he should choose to use this universally recognised cultural reference to explain his theory. Thus, Darwin easily engages the reader’s empathy as they recognise a shared cultural history.</p>
<p>       Although this biographical emotion is reemployed later on in the very same chapter, the intensity of the emotion shifts from mere shared cultural history to a raw societal wound. At the end of “Struggle for Existence,” Darwin explains that we can maintain “the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[43]</a></sub>  This mention of the noun “war” is of particular significance when one considers the position of the Crimean War (1853-56) to <em>The Origin</em>, which was published three years after the end of the war. The Crimean War, fought “between Russia and an alliance of Great Britain, France, Sardinia, and Turkey,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[44]</a></sub>  was an especially potent memory for British society at large, as it “was the first campaign to be reported on by a war correspondent.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[45]</a></sub>  Thus, at the mention of “war,” the unhealed memories of the brutalities of the Crimean War would flare up in the mind of the reader.</p>
<p>       Darwin utilises this shared social trauma to juxtapose the reality of “the war of nature”, which he claims does not have the long painful deaths and deep fear that so characterised the British soldiers’ experience of the Crimean War. Rather, his concluding words emphasise how “the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[46]</a></sub>  In this way, Darwin’s contrast between the ‘war of nature’ and a very human war is an instance of how he attempts to shift his theories away from that of the current human condition. Beer explains that “Darwin […] did take considerable pains […] to avoid legitimating current social order by naturalising it.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[47]</a></sub>  She does admit that the degree of success to which Darwin can claim to that is debatable. However, what is arguably more important is that this use of biographical emotion is an exercise of imagination and a marker of the literariness of the narrative of <em>The Origin</em>.</p>
<p>       Overall, one can see how crucial the literariness of Charles Darwin’s <em>On the Origin of Species</em> was to the persuasiveness of his argument. One can almost categorically argue that without the involvement of the reader, with their feelings of empathy, <em>The Origin</em> would have been far less impactful. Ultimately, Darwin’s employment of first-person narration and his delicate interweaving of cultural history is what enabled the narrative to engage the reader’s empathy so adeptly.</p>
<p>       As George Levine contends, <em>The Origin</em> represents “a new epistemology that grants authority […] to passion and desire, to the human and the living, rather than to disinterest and objectivity.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[48]</a></sub>  Through this notion of Darwin’s narrative being full of “passion”  and purpose, one can see it as a creative exercise of inducing change. Thus, as much as reviewers, like the Daily News, protested that imagination degenerated the veracity of the text, it is that very same imagination and creativity that has enabled <em>On the Origin of Species</em> to become the pre-eminent text that it remains today.</p>
