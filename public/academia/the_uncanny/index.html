<blockquote>
<p>[Uncanny] is a term used both to describe and create unease. <sub><a href="#endnotes">[1]</a></sub> <strong>(Rosemary Jackson, &lsquo;Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion,&rsquo; 63.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sigmund Freud, in his 1919 essay “The Uncanny,” draws the conclusion that fundamentally, “the uncanny […] arises either when repressed childhood complexes are revived by some impression, or when primitive beliefs that have been surmounted appear to be once again confirmed.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[2]</a></sub> However, Freud immediately revokes this neat conclusion by admitting that these two categories can be “impossible to distinguish” due to a “blurring of the boundaries.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[3]</a></sub> This notion of blurring and distortion is something that repeatedly reappears when examining the uncanny.</p>
<p>       This is true within the very terminology that we use to discuss this phenomenon. Uncanny is a translation from its German doppelgänger: the <em>unheimlich</em>. I refer to the <em>unheimlich</em> as the ‘doppelgänger’ of the uncanny as it is not a direct translation. As David Mclintock, a translator of Freud’s “The Uncanny”, explains: “the nearest semantic equivalents in English [to <em>unheimlich</em>] are ‘uncanny’ and ‘eerie’, but [it] etymologically corresponds to ‘unhomely’.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[4]</a></sub> Not only is this an issue if one investigates the uncanny in English, but even if one were to use the German <em>unheimlich</em>, one would still encounter the same blurring and ambiguity. A significant portion of Freud’s essay is dedicated to the semantic exhuming of the definition of the <em>unheimlich</em>, where he tracks its meandering history until determining that the <em>unheimlich</em> has been born from the convergence with its etymological root, and antonym: <em>heimlich</em> [homely]<sub><a href="#endnotes">[5]</a></sub>.</p>
<p>       As we have seen, blurring/warping/distortion is integral to the uncanny. However, Dylan Trigg takes this one step further by reframing the uncanny as the one who does the blurring. Departing from Freud’s emphasis that “the uncanny is to be understood fundamentally as <em>an effect</em>”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[6]</a></sub> [Emphasis added], Trigg resketches the uncanny as something that <em>affects</em>. He states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The uncanny refuses to concede to stillness […], the world of the uncanny […] subtly manipulates that familiar screen, thus engineering a shiver down the spine of anyone caught in its rays. At the heart of this shiver is the sense that what has so far been thought of as inconspicuous in its being is, in fact, charged with a creeping strangeness.</em> <sub><a href="#endnotes">[7]</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Trigg, the uncanny is something active and moving. Something “charged” and operational. Paradoxically, this immaterial concept is an agent. Working between things, causing palpable changes, and fundamentally arousing fear. It is this sense of the uncanny that I will be adopting in this essay. Moreover, as much as the uncanny is manifest in a multitude of ways, ranging from doppelgängers to severed limbs to being buried alive, these individual aspects will not be the focus of this essay. Rather, I will be examining the uncanny as an agent that is operational within supernatural stories. Particularly, I will be investigating the uncanny that is in full force in H. G. Wells’ short story “The Red Room” (1896). In this ghost story, we encounter the very core of the <em>unheimlich</em>: the haunted house. The home rendered unhomely. More than that, we encounter how the uncanny problematises our ontic reality, resulting in the problematisation of the self.</p>
<p>       To begin, let us focus upon how the workings of the uncanny blur and mutate our understanding of material reality in “The Red Room”. Within Wells’ tale, arguably the red room, or rather the haunted house as a whole, is this space where the uncanny thrives, lurking and refusing “to concede to stillness.” This is evident from the early paragraphs of the story, as the narrator describes the entrance of an “old man.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[8]</a></sub> He states that “the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man entered.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[9]</a></sub> By situating these two separate actions together in the same sentence, the man walking through the doorway and the door creaking on its hinges, it should indicate that these two actions are inextricably linked. To be frank, it ought to suggest that the man opened the door, thus causing it to creak.</p>
<p>       However, this is not how the sentence acts in practice. The conjunction, “as,” in this moment, can be defined as “introducing a contemporaneous event or action: at or during the time that”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[10]</a></sub> (OED). In this way, grammatically, the sentence does not explicitly indicate the causality of one action to another. Rather, in actuality, these are isolated incidents that happen to be occurring at the exact same time. This produces a feeling that is quite ominous. Here, we are witnessing the uncanny operating within this text: mutating a familiar act into a strange coincidence. Distorting the ordinary, till it becomes extraordinary and disturbing. This example is especially significant as it literally demonstrates the operations of the uncanny. It neither resides in the creaking of the door, nor in the body of the old man, but rather in the unassuming connection between the two. On the margin. Blurring and fusing two spaces. It both is and is not. This realm of paradox in which the uncanny resides is something we will witness consistently reappear.</p>
<p>       Moreover, the uncanny’s power to deform our sense of material reality becomes even more apparent as the narrative progresses. Once the narrator enters the red room, he explains to the reader that his purpose for being here is parallel to his ghost-hunting predecessor, who had a tragic end to his “vigil.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[11]</a></sub> Beyond that, “there were other older stories that clung to the room, back to the half-credible beginning of it all.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[12]</a></sub> By “stories,” the narrator is not suggesting that physical books are literally adorning this room. A “story” is an intangible anthropological construct, it cannot be touched, and it certainly cannot cling to a room. The metaphoricity of this sentence mutates the notion of a “story” from an immaterial concept into something palpable. In this way, because we are dealing with an ontic issue, we come face to face with the uncanny.</p>
<p>       More than this, the notion of the past within the presence, as is exhibited in the “older” clinging to the now, is an example of the uncanny in and of itself. Of course, we have been discussing material reality, which has more obvious ties to physical location and space. However, as Trigg reminds us “time and place form another dovetailing pair.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[13]</a></sub> He goes on to explain that “it is only through materializing itself in place that the felt experience of time gains its powers.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[14]</a></sub> Thus, this perennial presence of something from the past that ought to have faded away is what makes it uncanny. Particularly, it is the verb “clung” in which the uncanny operates. It is through this active clinging where the uncanny fuses the past and the present together. Something that should be impossible, yet according to the narrator’s empirical findings, it is not. It is this anachronism of the haunted house that is distinctly uncanny, as something out of the natural order of time and place.</p>
<p>       This perversion of our understanding of the fixed workings of the universe resurfaces later on in the short story, during its climax. As the narrator continues to explore this haunted room, he encounters something. In spite of his repeated attempts to keep the candles alight, “the flame vanished, as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and thumb,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[15]</a></sub>  as well as “an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two candles on the table.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[16]</a></sub> These examples of a “finger and thumb” and a “hand” appear to be without a body, seemingly existing severed and floating. Such “independent activity”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[17]</a></sub>  of limbs and digits would give Freud immediate cause to designate this moment as “highly uncanny.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[18]</a></sub> However, this prognosis would be because he believed that “this species of the uncanny stems from its proximity to the castration complex,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[19]</a></sub> as he discussed in his analysis of ETA Hoffman’s “The Sandman”. I believe that this is an unproductive way of viewing this moment in Wells’ story. To restrict this uncanny to merely represent the fear of castration is to leave unacknowledged its power as an agent.</p>
<p>       More than simply ‘an effect,’ the uncanny is working to create the impossible: to subvert the natural order of the universe. Of course, a solitary limb working independently is disturbing, but specifically where it resides is far more supernatural. These spectral limbs/digits emerge from within the “shadows”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[20]</a></sub> and the “darkness.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[21]</a></sub> However, it is not the darkness itself that is uncanny, as much as Freud would advocate that “solitude, silence and darkness”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[22]</a></sub> is what creates the uncanny. What is more significant than that, is that the notion that something has been born from nothing. Yet this is entirely contradicted to the first law of thermodynamics. When “The Red Room” was published, Lord Kelvin’s law (that energy can neither be created nor destroyed) had already been established for 45 years<sub><a href="#endnotes">[23]</a></sub>. Thus, to be able to create something from nothing, is an occurrence that is completely outside of the workings of the known universe. In this way, we can see just how powerful the uncanny is, affecting the narrator’s (and in turn the reader’s) understanding of physics and ontic reality.</p>
<p>       This aligns with what Rosemary Jackson emphasises about the uncanny, about how it is inherently “transgressive,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[24]</a></sub> that it is part of the “Literature of Subversion”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[25]</a></sub>. She explains that the uncanny operates by “Un-doing those unifying structures and significations upon which social order depends, fantasy functions to subvert and undermine cultural stability.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[26]</a></sub> Although Jackson’s statement places more emphasis on the implications the uncanny has on “cultural stability,” arguably this is still highly relevant to the effects upon the “social order” when ontic reality is called into question.</p>
<p>       By the end of H. G. Wells’ short story, the narrator is filled with such absolute terror that in his attempts to flee the red room, he knocks himself unconscious. In spite of his foggy memory, he believes that he has determined precisely what haunts that room. He announces that it is “in all its nakedness – Fear! Fear that will not have light nor sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and overwhelms.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[27]</a></sub> The manifestation of this abstract emotion, “Fear,” does not render this haunting any more logical or reasonable than if the narrator were to declare the room haunted by a ghoul. The portrayal of “Fear” as an agent that is capable of creating such effects on human beings is very reminiscent of the uncanny. It should be all the less surprising considering that the uncanny is “a species of the frightening,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[28]</a></sub> as ‘Fear’ and the uncanny are deeply interwoven.</p>
<p>       One of the custodians, to whom the narrator is explaining his prognosis, deeply resonates with this explanation. He agrees that “There is Fear in that room of hers – black Fear, and there will be – so long as this house of sin endures.”<sub>[<a href="#endnotes">29</a></sub> At first it might appear that he is suggesting that “Fear,” or the uncanny, is tied and restricted the to the “house of sin.” As if the life force of the uncanny is somehow contained or fuelled by the house. Upon closer inspection, however, the uncanny is certainly not that vulnerable. When the custodian states the terms upon which the uncanny’s presence is predicated, whether or not the house “endures,” this does not dictate the survival or endurance of the uncanny. Even if the material architecture of the house were to be destroyed, and every brick removed and displaced, the only thing that would change is whether there “is Fear in that room”. The uncanny does not cease to exist if the house ceases to exist. It goes beyond the restrictions of our known physical reality. So, what would happen if the house were destroyed? What would happen to the uncanny? Although there can be no certainty, with the view that the uncanny is an active agent, we can presume that it would simply go elsewhere. That it would move on, ready to haunt somewhere else, or rather someone else.</p>
<p>       As much as we can see that the uncanny disturbs our understanding of material reality, within “The Red Room,” the uncanny disrupts our very existence as human beings. Let us return to the beginning of this tale, where there are three bodies that are overtly warped by the uncanny; these are the bodies of the “three old pensioners.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[30]</a></sub> One third of the eerie trio is introduced as “the man with the withered arm”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[31]</a></sub> – an epithet that haunts him for the rest of the text. Further down the page, we are introduced to another aging man who is described as being “more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[32]</a></sub> as well as an “old woman.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[33]</a></sub> Whether it be the first man whose name is substituted by a distinct characteristic of his senectitude, or the woman who is simply characterised as “old,” they are all represented by their aging bodies.</p>
<p>       Growing old is not inherently disturbing or unfamiliar, it is something humanity is intimately acquainted with. However, this familiarity is precisely what renders it vulnerable to the operations of the uncanny. Within this text, old age is mutated from a natural process into something alienated. The narrator expresses that the “three of them made me feel uncomfortable, with their gaunt silences, their bent carriage.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[34]</a></sub> Through his use of the transitive verb “made,” the narrator implies that the custodians are intentionally trying to make him “feel uncomfortable” through their lack of speech, but most especially, through their bodies. That they have morphed their bodies this way to purposefully arouse discomfort in him. Of course, this does not make sense, as it is impossible to will the human body to age or decrease in age. In spite of this impossibility, this does not prevent the narrator from truly experiencing “senility”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[35]</a></sub> as “something crouching and atavistic,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[36]</a></sub> nor does it prevent him from feeling “uncomfortable.” Thus, we are forced to turn to the explanation of the uncanny. To use Trigg’s phrasing from before, the uncanny “subtly manipulates that familiar screen.” It distorts three aging bodies into “grotesque custodians.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[37]</a></sub> Whilst the narrator believes he experiences this unease at the hands of the three, in reality it is the uncanny that acts under cloak of invisibility, twisting and manipulating what should be empirical fact till it becomes estranged from the human eye.</p>
<p>       Moreover, the sense of the uncanny comes to shift even more into focus as the story progresses. As the narrator leaves the custodians, he confesses that “The oddness of these three old custodians in whose charge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep toned, old-fashioned furniture of the housekeeper’s room in which they forgathered, affected me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matter-of-fact phase.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[38]</a></sub> The narrator’s implementation of the noun “oddness” should immediately alert us to the presence of the uncanny. As Anthony Vidler explains, the uncanny has been perceived “at times as indistinguishable from the sublime,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[39]</a></sub> (particularly the Burkean notion of ‘terror’), yet it is not “absolute terror,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[40]</a></sub> nor is it “mild anxiety.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[41]</a></sub> Rather it should be better understood as a “sense of lurking unease.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[42]</a></sub> This “oddness,” or uncanniness, is produced both through the “old custodians” and the “old-fashioned furniture.” However, by categorising the old people and the furniture together, the implication is that the “old custodians” are part of the very fabric of this house. They have lost their status as humans and their ontological existence has been fused with the material outside. Two materially different objects have become one in this mode of language. Outside and inside have melded and the boundaries between the body and the space have become indistinguishable. This work of the uncanny forces the narrator to question the very makeup of a human.</p>
<p>       We must not forget the etymological origin of the uncanny, or rather <em>unheimlich</em>, in the sense of ‘unhomeliness.’ Thus, it should be no surprise that Freud claims that “in some languages the German phrase <em>ein unheimliches Haus</em> [‘an uncanny house’] can be rendered only by the periphrasis ‘a haunted house’”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[43]</a></sub> and that it is “perhaps the most potent”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[44]</a></sub> example of the ‘uncanny’. In this way, the haunted house is so saturated by the uncanny, that beyond the fabric of the house, its very inhabitants are rendered uncanny.</p>
<p>       As much as this is true for the custodians, this also extends to the narrator. To return to the early paragraphs of the tale, the narrator describes an instance where he “caught a glimpse of [himself], abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the queer old mirror.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[45]</a></sub> As the adjective “abbreviated” belongs to the semantic field of linguistics, it is very strange that the narrator would apply this term to describe how his body looks, rather than simply use the word ‘shortened’. By appropriating this strange term, the narrator alienates his body beyond not only what he can see, but he also warps it for the mind-eye of the reader as well.</p>
<p>       Furthermore, he expresses that he has been transformed into an “impossible sturdiness.” Here we encounter a deeply ontological issue: there is doubt about the realness and concreteness of himself. This is very clearly the work of the uncanny. The familiarity of his own body has been perverted almost beyond recognition; his ‘self’ has been transformed into something “impossible”. If what he sees is true, then he should not exist. It is significant that this moment occurs “in the queer old mirror,” as this means that the narrator’s experience of self-alienation is happening ‘without’ himself. Not only this, but this self-mutation is occurring in the fabric of the house. Once again, we witness the haunted house as the stage upon which the uncanny operates and plays its tricks.</p>
<p>       All that I have just described of the working of the uncanny has occurred far before the climax of the story ever comes into view. Later on in the story, the uncanny comes to fully permeate the narrator when goes to spend the night in the red room itself. The sense of the enclosing darkness compels him to light candles all around the room to keep away the “shiver.” Alas, some supernatural force swiftly extinguishes every source of light, in spite of his extreme persistence. When the last glow of an ember in the fireplace dims “like the shutting of an eye,”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[46]</a></sub> the narrator’s sanity becomes compromised. His memories of these moments are dim and unclear, but he has “a vague memory of battering [himself] thus, to and fro in the darkness, of a cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as [he] darted to and fro.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[47]</a></sub> This description of the narrator’s body taking over from his own will and throwing itself around blindly as he has no control of it, holds a distinctly uncanny sense, echoing back to the origins of Freud’s psychoanalytical investigations.</p>
<p>       Freud explains that there is an “uncanny effect produced by epileptic fits and the manifestation of insanity.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[48]</a></sub> This means that the narrator himself has been transformed into an example of the uncanny. Freud specifically explains that it is a sense of uncanniness felt by the “onlooker.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[49]</a></sub> In this way, the feeling of the uncanny has mutated from: something seen in the custodians and felt in the narrator, into one seen in the narrator and felt in the reader. We get the sense that the ‘uncanny’ is some living, breathing organism, perhaps a parasite. Travelling and feeding off its victims, before moving on to the next, but not before leaving an indelible mark.</p>
<p>       However, with that being said, one must not forget, that as much as the uncanny is an agent, it is also no thing at all. It is a phenomenon. There is no material object it can be tied to, yet we still see its effects. That is the paradox of the uncanny it is both something and nothing. Active, yet it is impossible for a nothing to produce a something. As Trigg states, the uncanny exists “in the manifold space between experience and thought, perfectly at ease with its ability to invoke repulsion and allure in the subject experiencing the uncanny.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[50]</a></sub></p>
<p>       After examining how the uncanny warps our understanding of both the world around us and indeed our ‘selves’, it will be useful to consider this statement by Trigg: “The body activates place. But the same is true in reverse: Place activates the body.”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[51]</a></sub> Whilst Trigg makes no explicit mention of the ‘uncanny’ here, this “twofold motion between place and body”<sub><a href="#endnotes">[52]</a></sub> is inherently uncanny, as it is a blurring of boundaries. In this way, we can understand the verb “activates” to mean that the uncanny is something that is tirelessly at work, constantly moving between spaces in a way that both seems familiar yet is so entirely disturbing.</p>
